## Features  
- **Fruit Recognition**: Identify a wide variety of fruits through the camera or image upload.  
- **Caloric Estimation**: Estimate caloric content based on the type and quantity of the fruit.  
- **Cloud Integration**: Efficiently process and store data using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive app design for ease of use.  
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Native Android app built with Kotlin.

## How It Works  
1. **Image Input**: Users upload an image of a fruit or take a photo directly within the app.  
2. **Fruit Recognition**: The app utilizes a CNN model to classify the fruit based on features like shape, color, and texture.  
3. **Calorie Estimation**: The app retrieves the caloric value of the identified fruit using preloaded nutritional data.  
4. **Results Display**: Nutritional information, including calories, is displayed to the user.
